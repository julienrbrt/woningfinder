## How Is Supported Each Housing Corporation

Note, some Housing Corporations worked together in order to post their offers on a common website. In that case that is that common website that is supported by WoningFinder.

**[De Woonplaats](https://dewoonplaats.com)**
[De Woonplaats] is supported by reverse engineering their API. We make requests to their API as if we are in a browser.

**[OnsHuis](https://mijn.onshuis.com)**
OnsHuis is supported by using website scrapping, they do not seems to have any API, so we scrape their website in order to get their offers.
